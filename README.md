The distributed operation layer is a software development framework to program parallel applications. The DOL allows to specify applications based on the Kahn process network model of computation and features a simulation engine based on System C.
In a word, the DOL provides an XML-based specification format to describe the implementation of a parallel application o a multi-processor systems, including binding and mapping
> The installing note
The first step is to install some necessary environment in the Ubuntu;
The second step is to install the Dolethz.zip and then decompress the Dolethz.zip and systemc.tgz;
The third step is to compile the systemc in an empty file;
At last, compile the DOL, and check that the configuration is successful
> The Conclusion
In fact, the experiment is successful with the help of TA. Because some PCs just can`t install the DOL successfully, maybe it is the problem of the virtual machine that the PC uses. And the most important thing is that we learn the basic framework of DOL through the experiment and we will get to know the deeper knowledge of DOL in the future work.
