##explain

First of all, in example1, there are a formula: i = i*i in square.c, which means it returns the square of i. And our first mission is to let example1 outputs the third power of i. It`s obviously that we should let i = i*i*i;(The most important thing is that I follow TA`s advice)
Our second mission is to run example2 and let the number of the module becomes 2;As TA`s tip, I check the example2.xml and find the iterator it it. Finding that there is a variable named N, and its value is 3, and the range of the iteration is N, so it is obviously that we should let the value of N become 2 if we want to let the number of module become 2.
That`s all

##Thinking

What the lab wants us to learn is that knpwing the structure of DOL and testing the DOL example for ourselves. And in the experiment, I learn that how one module contects to another module and the relation between them generator and consumer. It`s like the concept of OS. So, I think the embedded system is a little familiar.
